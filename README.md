- What were your priorities, and why?

Get the structure setup properly so MVVM is ahered to. Structure is important.
Parsing data correctly with Codable. 
Get it vaguely resemnbling the design but gettting it functional to do most of the things required.
Unit tests, as important to try and write as much of these as you can 

- If you had more time, what would you have tackled next? - what would you change about the structure of the code?

The timer count down just used date for now.
Getting design better , fonts and things.
I spent a lot of time getting used to MVVM structure and checking it worked, so I think I changed the structure to this

- What bugs did you find but not fix?

There was a problem with layout of the text. Constraints. List was very very long so hard to see the scheduled results, but focussed on code more than fixing. Perhaps some things not in the  JSON

- What would you change about the visual design of the app?

I would have two tabs so one for scheduled and one for finished so you don't have to scroll down... also add a filters button to filter teams or search. Generally I thought it looked good?
